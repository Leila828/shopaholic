Installation
============

1. Install `django-oscar-api` using the `documentation <https://django-oscar-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation>`_.

2. Install the `django-oscar-api-checkout` package.::

    $ pip install django-oscar-api-checkout

3. Add `oscarapicheckout` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`::

    # myproject/settings.py
    ...
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'oscarapicheckout',
    ] + get_core_apps([])
    ...

4. Configure Oscar's order status pipeline.::

    # myproject/settings.py
    ...
    # Needed by oscarapicheckout
    ORDER_STATUS_PENDING = 'Pending'
    ORDER_STATUS_PAYMENT_DECLINED = 'Payment Declined'
    ORDER_STATUS_AUTHORIZED = 'Authorized'

    # Other statuses
    ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED = 'Shipped'
    ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED = 'Canceled'

    # Pipeline Config
    OSCAR_INITIAL_ORDER_STATUS = ORDER_STATUS_PENDING
    OSCARAPI_INITIAL_ORDER_STATUS = ORDER_STATUS_PENDING
    OSCAR_ORDER_STATUS_PIPELINE = {
        ORDER_STATUS_PENDING: (ORDER_STATUS_PAYMENT_DECLINED, ORDER_STATUS_AUTHORIZED, ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED),
        ORDER_STATUS_PAYMENT_DECLINED: (ORDER_STATUS_AUTHORIZED, ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED),
        ORDER_STATUS_AUTHORIZED: (ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED, ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED),
        ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED: (),
        ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED: (),
    }

    OSCAR_INITIAL_LINE_STATUS = ORDER_STATUS_PENDING
    OSCAR_LINE_STATUS_PIPELINE = {
        ORDER_STATUS_PENDING: (ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED, ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED),
        ORDER_STATUS_SHIPPED: (),
        ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED: (),
    }

5. Configure what payment methods are enabled and who can use them.::

    # myproject/settings.py
    ...
    API_ENABLED_PAYMENT_METHODS = [
        {
            'method': 'oscarapicheckout.methods.Cash',
            'permission': 'oscarapicheckout.permissions.StaffOnly',
        },
        {
            'method': 'some.other.methods.CreditCard',
            'permission': 'oscarapicheckout.permissions.Public',
        },
    ]

6. Add `oscarapicheckout` to your root URL configuration directly before oscarapi.::

    # myproject/urls.py
    ...
    from oscarapi.app import application as oscar_api
    from oscarapicheckout.app import application as oscar_api_checkout

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^api/', include(oscar_api_checkout.urls)), # Must be before oscar_api.urls
        url(r'^api/', include(oscar_api.urls)),
        ...
    )


Usage
=====

These are the basic steps to add an item to the basket and checkout using the API.

1. Add an item to the basket.::

    POST /api/basket/add-product/

    {
        "url": "/api/products/1/",
        "quantity": 1
    }


2. List the payment methods available to the current user.::

    GET /api/checkout/payment-methods/

3. Submit the order, specifying which payment method(s) to use.::

    POST /api/checkout/

    {
        "guest_email": "joe@example.com",
        "basket": "/api/baskets/1/",
        "shipping_address": {
            "first_name": "Joe",
            "last_name": "Schmoe",
            "line1": "234 5th Ave",
            "line4": "Manhattan",
            "postcode": "10001",
            "state": "NY",
            "country": "/api/countries/US/",
            "phone_number": "+1 (717) 467-1111",
        },
        "billing_address": {
            "first_name": "Joe",

        "payment": {
            "cash": {
                "enabled": true,
                "amount": "10.00",
            },
            "creditcard": {

Changelog
=========

0.4.1
------------------
- Fixed bug that prevented transitioning an order from ``Payment Declined`` to ``Authorized`` if the payment type was changed.

0.4.0
------------------
- Improved split-pay support by allowing multiple payments of the same type. E.g. two credit cards, etc.
    - *[Important]* To accomplish this, the payment provider plug-in interface changed slightly. Plugins must be updated to support the new interface. The REST API front-end added parameters, but retained backwards compatibility with ``0.3.x``.
- Fixed bug caused by changing the status of a Payment Declined order (e.g. to Canceled) caused checkout to break for the customer, because they were now editable a basket connected to a non-payment-declined order. Fixes the bug by setting a basket to "Submitted" status whenever the order status transitions from "Payment Declined" to another status.

0.3.4
------------------
- Fix Django 2.0 Deprecation warnings.

0.3.3
------------------
- Add validation to checkout API to prevent placing an order for an item that went out of stock after the item was added to the customer's basket.

0.3.2
------------------
- Fix issue in Python 3 when ``OrderCreator.place_order`` raises a ``ValueError`` exception.
- Fix bug occurring in Oscar 1.5 when vouchers can be used by the user placing an order, but not by the order owner.

0.3.1
------------------
- Add support for Django 1.11 and Oscar 1.5

0.3.0
------------------
- Add helper classes for caching structured data during a multi-step checkout process.
    - See `oscarapicheckout.cache` module for details.
    - Doesn't yet include API views for editing or view such data.
    - Currently includes classes for storing email address, shipping address, billing address, and shipping method.
    - Required [Django Cache](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/) framework to be configured.

0.2.7
------------------
- *[Important]* Fix bug introduced in *r0.2.6* with multi-step payment methods when retrying a payment decline.

0.2.6
------------------
- *[Important]* Fix bug causing mismatch between ``Order.user`` and ``Basket.owner`` when, during placement, the order ownership calculator assigns the order to a user other than the basket owner. Now, after creating the order model, the owner of the basket associated with the order is updated to match the order's owner.
- Make it possible to set the ``ORDER_OWNERSHIP_CALCULATOR`` to a callable or a string instead of just a string.

0.2.5
------------------
- Improve testing by using tox in the CI runner.

0.2.4
------------------
- Upgrade dependencies.

0.2.3
------------------
- Make the order in which signals are sent during checkout consistent for synchronous and asynchronous payment methods.
    - Previously a synchronous payment method resulted in sending ``order_payment_authorized`` before sending ``order_placed``, but an asynchronous payment method would trigger ``order_placed`` first followed by ``order_payment_authorized`` (on a subsequent HTTP request). They are still different in terms of synchronous payment methods firing both signals on the same request and asynchronous payment methods triggering them on different request, but at least now they are always fired in the same order: ``order_placed`` first followed by ``order_payment_authorized``.

0.2.2
------------------
- Require an email address during checkout

0.2.1
------------------
- Explicitly dis-allow cache on API views

0.2.0
------------------
- Add setting to allow configuring how many payment types may be used on an order
- Add hook for setting the ownership information on an order during placement
- Prevent PaymentEvent.reference from ever being None

0.1.5
------------------
- Fix bug where order number wouldn't be recycled for a declined order

0.1.4
------------------
- Add context to payment method serializers

0.1.3
------------------
- Simplify dependencies

0.1.2
------------------
- Allow PaymentMethods to handle 0.00-amount transactions

0.1.1
------------------
- Send confirmation message upon order authorization
- Add pep8 linting

0.1.0
------------------
- Initial release.
